# RAG-assistant
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and ChromaDB. It embeds a corpus of documents (news reports on inflation, AI policy, and climate change), retrieves relevant chunks for user queries, and generates grounded answers with an LLM via the Groq API.
